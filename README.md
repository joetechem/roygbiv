# ROYGBIV Guessing Game  

## Random Pick  

The program randomly chooses an item (color) from the list (colors from the rainbow) and puts the item into a variable. The program pauses until the user types in a color, i.e. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, or violet. Based on the name of the color entered, the program will tell the user if they guessed correctly or not.  

## Scoring System  

Just like golf, the lower the score, the better! For example, once *d_timer_roygbiv.py* is executed, each guess made by the user is added to the score. Once, the user guesses correctly, the program returns the total amount of guesses made.
