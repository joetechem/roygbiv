# ROYGBIV Guessing Game  

Under the src folder, this program is divided into lessons (starting at *a_*).  

## What does the Final Program Do?  

* Randomly picks from a list  
* Handles user input with conditionals  
* Tracks the score during a user's session  
* Starts a timer as soon as the game starts  

## Random Pick  

The program randomly chooses an item (color) from the list (colors from the rainbow) and puts the item into a variable. The program pauses until the user types in a color, i.e. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, or violet. Based on the name of the color entered, the program will tell the user if they guessed correctly or not.  

## Scoring System  

Just like golf, the lower the score, the better! For example, once *d_timer_roygbiv.py* is executed, each guess made by the user is added to the score. Once, the user guesses correctly, the program returns the total amount of guesses made.  

## Timer  

From the moment the first guess is made, the timer starts counting. The actual timer may vary depending on the Python version.
